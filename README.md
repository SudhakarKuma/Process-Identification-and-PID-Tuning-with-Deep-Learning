# Process-Identification-and-PID-Tuning-with-Deep-Learning
A program that can do Process Identification and PID Tuning by using Deep Learning designed for people studying and researching chemical engineering.

A method of approximating a process to First Order Plus Time Delay(FOPTD) or Second Order Plus Time Delay(SOPTD) using unit step input change data and Deep Learning. In other words, by using Deep learning, the process variables like time constant, time delay and decay ratio are obtained.

Although there are many types of First or secondary processes with  time delay, they are approximated in the simplest form of K/(τs+1) e^(-θs) and K/(τ^2 s^2+2ξτs+1) e^(-θs)

PID Tuning using ITAE Tuning Method and IMC Tuning Method is also implemented.
